    <p>Steve Jobs once said, <q>One home run is much better than two
      doubles.</q></p>

    <blockquote cite="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/01/24/272277/index.htm">
      <p>“In most people’s vocabularies, design is a veneer. It’s interior
      decorating. It’s the fabric of the curtains, of the sofa. But to me,
      nothing could be further from the meaning of design. Design is the
      fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up expressing itself
      in successive outer layers of the product.”</p>
